[Foodsoft](https://foodcoops.github.io/) is a web-based software to manage a non-profit food coop (product catalog, ordering, accounting, job scheduling). A food cooperative is a group of people that buy food from suppliers of their own choosing. A collective do-it-yourself supermarket. Members order their products online and collect them on a specified day. And all put in a bit of work to make that possible. Foodsoft facilitates the process.
